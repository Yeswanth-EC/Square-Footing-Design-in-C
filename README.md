# Square-Footing-Design-in-C
This program automates the calculations needed to design a square footing, ensuring it can safely carry the load without failing in shear or bending. By considering the material properties (concrete and steel), soil conditions, and structural loads, it helps engineers design safe, efficient footings for various types of buildings and structures.
